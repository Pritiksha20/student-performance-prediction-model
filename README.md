# 🛡️ Spam & Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning


### 📌 Overview

This project implements machine learning-based spam and fraud detection to classify messages, emails, or financial transactions as genuine or fraudulent. It utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to identify suspicious patterns, improving cybersecurity and reducing risks.

### 🚀 Features
- ✅ Spam Detection – Filters out spam emails, SMS, or messages.
- ✅ Fraud Detection – Identifies fraudulent activities in transactions.
- ✅ Machine Learning-Based – Uses SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.
- ✅ Natural Language Processing (NLP) – Analyzes text data for spam filtering.
- ✅ Feature Engineering – Extracts key features like word frequency, sender credibility, and transaction amount.
- ✅ Accuracy Optimization – Uses hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-score).

### 🏗️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍

- NumPy & Pandas – Data processing

- Scikit-Learn – Machine learning models

- NLTK – Natural Language Processing

- Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

### 📜 How It Works
- Data Collection: Loads dataset (emails, SMS, or transaction records).

- Data Preprocessing: Cleans and tokenizes text, removes stopwords, applies TF-IDF/CountVectorizer for feature extraction.

- Model Training: Uses ML classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest).

- Evaluation: Tests models with confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall.

- Prediction: Classifies new messages or transactions as spam/fraud or legitimate.
